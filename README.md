## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! Iâ€™m a full-stack developer building SaaS applications using Supabase as the backend and SvelteKit on the frontend. This repository showcases my work in creating modern, performant web apps that are fast to build, easy to scale, and enjoyable to use.

On the frontend, Iâ€™m using SvelteKit for its simplicity, speed, and powerful reactivity model. It enables me to write minimal, readable code while delivering highly responsive interfaces. Iâ€™m exploring features like server-side rendering, load functions, API routes, and transitions to build user experiences that feel both dynamic and seamless.

For the backend, I rely on Supabase to handle authentication, database operations, and real-time capabilities. With its PostgreSQL core, auto-generated APIs, and built-in role-based access control, Supabase allows me to build secure, production-ready apps without needing to set up everything from scratch. I also use Supabaseâ€™s edge functions and storage to support more advanced SaaS features.

This repository contains full-stack templates, components, and project structures that Iâ€™ve developed while experimenting with features like user onboarding, billing integration, multi-tenancy, and dashboard analytics. I aim to build reusable pieces that can accelerate development for future SaaS ideas.

My focus is on clean architecture, efficient data flow, and maintainability. I enjoy combining these modern tools to bring ideas to life quickly, while learning more about best practices in both frontend and backend development.

If youâ€™re interested in SvelteKit, Supabase, or SaaS development in general, feel free to explore the code, leave feedback, or connect. Iâ€™m always looking to learn more and collaborate with others building in the modern web ecosystem.

Thanks for checking it outâ€”and hereâ€™s to launching great products, one feature at a time.
